 'description': "In Villainous, each player takes control of one of six Disney 
    characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie. Each player has 
    their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.<br/><br/>
    On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location 
    on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that 
    space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to 
    four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, conditions, and (for some 
    characters) curses. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win 
    condition.<br/><br/>One of the actions allows you to choose another player, 
    draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that 
    player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that 
    player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from 
    that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that 
    particular villain.<br/><br/>",
